Automated Job Application App

Overview: AI Job Application Assistant

1. Business Overview
Concept:
Develop an AI-powered app that automates job searching by:
•	Scraping or integrating with job listing sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.).
•	Using DeepSeek r1 to analyze job descriptions and match them with a user's resume.
•	Customizing and submitting applications automatically.

Target Market:
•	Job seekers looking for high-volume applications (e.g., recent graduates, laid-off professionals, freelancers).
•	Passive job seekers who want new opportunities without active searching.

8. Next Steps
1.	Validate market demand via a landing page & pre-signups.
2.	Start developing MVP with a focus on resume parsing and job matching first.
3.	Launch a beta version within 3 months and iterate based on user feedback in AWS DevOps
